This screen will provide the users to login as a registered user or provider as well as sign up as a user or provider. The difference between the two is that providers are the ones who maintain the app and the users are regular customers who are seeking for a car wash.

This sidebar screen or navigation pane allows user and/or providers an easier way to navigate to specific orders they've placed in recent times, navigate to the settings, home page, and also logout of their account.

This screen provides the users a preview of the map of their current location where all nearby car washs are located at. It also allows the user to view the information of that specific car wash they plan on visiting and making an appointment for.
